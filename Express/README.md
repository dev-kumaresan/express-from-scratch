# Authentication
# Routing
Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).
# Cookies
Cookies are simple, small files/data that are sent to client with a server request and stored on the client side. Every time the user loads the website back, this cookie is sent with the request. This helps us keep track of the user’s actions.

```npm install cookie-parser```
<br>
```const cookie = require('cookie-parser');```
# JSON access
# Middleware
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle. These functions are used to modify req and res objects for tasks like parsing request bodies, adding response headers, etc.
# MongoDB
# RESTFul APIs
# Sessions
# Template Engines
A template engine facilitates you to use static template files in your applications. At runtime, it replaces variables in a template file with actual values, and transforms the template into an HTML file sent to the client. So this approach is preferred to design HTML pages easily.
